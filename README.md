# ðŸ“˜ MAD_23012011130_Practical2:  Understanding Activity Lifecycle & Simple UI in Android

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective of this practical is to demonstrate how the **Activity Lifecycle** works in Android, along with creating a basic user interface that includes a styled "Hello World" text and lifecycle feedback via Toasts, Logs, and Snackbars.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Lifecycle Demonstration**  
  Implement all lifecycle methods (`onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onRestart`, `onDestroy`) so that each one:  
  - Shows a `Toast`  
  - Prints a `Log` message

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.  
3. Run it on an emulator or a physical Android phone.  
4. Interact with the app to see:  
   - The **"Hello World"** UI  
   - Lifecycle logs in **Logcat**  
   - Toast & Snackbar notifications for each lifecycle method  

---

## ðŸ”„ Testing the Lifecycle
- Launch the app â†’ `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume` are called  
- Press **Home** or switch apps â†’ `onPause`, then `onStop`  
- Return to the app â†’ `onRestart`, `onStart`, `onResume`  
- Close the app â†’ `onDestroy`  

Youâ€™ll see **Log messages**, **Toasts**, and **Snackbars** for every state change.

## ðŸ“š Lifecycle Explanation
- **`onCreate()`** â†’ Initializes the activity and UI  
- **`onStart()`** â†’ Activity is visible  
- **`onResume()`** â†’ Activity is ready for user input  
- **`onPause()`** â†’ Activity is partially hidden  
- **`onStop()`** â†’ Activity is fully hidden  
- **`onRestart()`** â†’ Called when coming back from `onStop()`  
- **`onDestroy()`** â†’ Final cleanup before removal  

âž¡ Flow: **Create â†’ Start â†’ Resume â†’ Pause â†’ Stop â†’ Restart/Destroy**
